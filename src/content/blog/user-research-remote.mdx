Remote user research used to be the backup plan. Now it's often the default. Here's how to make it work.

## The setup matters more than you think

Before your first participant joins, nail the basics:

- **Test your tech** — Do a dry run with a colleague. Check audio, screen sharing, and recording
- **Have a backup plan** — Phone number ready, alternative meeting link prepared
- **Minimize distractions** — Close notifications, use a clean desktop background
- **Good lighting and audio** — Participants need to see your reactions and hear you clearly

## Building rapport through a screen

The hardest part of remote research is building trust quickly. Without the natural warmth of being in the same room, you need to work harder:

**Start with small talk.** Ask about their day, their setup, where they're calling from. This isn't wasted time — it's essential warmup.

**Use your camera.** Even if participants turn theirs off, keep yours on. It humanizes the interaction.

**Acknowledge the awkwardness.** "I know video calls can feel a bit strange" goes a long way toward putting people at ease.

## Adapting your methods

Some research methods translate directly to remote; others need modification:

### Interviews
Work almost identically to in-person. The main difference is you lose some body language cues, so ask more follow-up questions to ensure understanding.

### Usability testing
Request participants share their screen (not the other way around). This shows you their actual environment, browser extensions, and natural behaviors.

### Card sorting and similar activities
Use tools like Optimal Workshop or Miro. Walk participants through the interface before starting, and give them permission to think aloud about any confusion.

## Reading the room (virtually)

Without physical presence, you need to tune into different signals:

- **Silence** often means confusion, not agreement
- **Hesitation** before answering suggests uncertainty
- **Tone of voice** carries more weight than usual
- **Questions about the question** indicate unclear prompts

## The debrief is crucial

After each session, take 10 minutes to capture:

1. Top 3 insights while they're fresh
2. Quotes worth revisiting
3. Moments of confusion or frustration
4. Anything that surprised you

Don't wait until you've done all your sessions — the details fade faster than you think.

## Tools I recommend

- **Zoom or Google Meet** for sessions (with recording enabled)
- **Dovetail or Reframer** for analysis and tagging
- **Miro** for collaborative activities
- **Calendly** for scheduling (with buffer time between sessions)

## One final tip

Remote research is tiring — for you and participants. Keep sessions to 45-60 minutes max, and schedule no more than 3-4 per day. Quality beats quantity every time.
